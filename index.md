Hello! This is Sirakorn Lamyai (they/them).

I am currently a so-called Data Engineer at Adastra. "So-called" means I also take care of anything that is needed to keep my clientsâ€™ data pipelines running smoothly (generally this includes observability, DevOps, and semi-SRE), and also do some management/executive decisions in the company.

I graduated from Department of Computer Engineering at Kasetsart University (Bangkhen Campus) with second degree honour. I worked on Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning models as my dissertation.

I also used to work on Machine Learning, Data Science, and Brain-Controlled Interfaces (BCIs) in several settings, from business, academic, to research.

On a more "presonal" side of life, I am a father of [HugHug the Cavalier](https://instagram.com/ihughugyou), enjoy tinkering my home with Smart Home and 3D printing, is a coffee and tea snob, and likes eating a lot.
